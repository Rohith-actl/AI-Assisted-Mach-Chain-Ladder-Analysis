# AI-Assisted-Mack-Chain-Ladder-Analysis

I built an end-to-end actuarial reserving pipeline in R using claims triangles and the Mack Chain Ladder method. The project takes paid claims data, estimates ultimate losses and IBNR, and quantifies uncertainty using standard errors and coefficients of variation. I added scenario testing and data quality checks to flag unstable years and concentration risk. An AI component is used purely to interpret patterns and generate a professional actuarial narrative, while all reserve estimates remain model-driven and transparent.
